# blockchain-developer-bootcamp-final-project

- The project I chose to work is about solving a problem that crowdfunding platforms have by : 
         -  Using smart contracts technology to improve the trustability of the funds. 


The platform will contain blockchain projects made by developpers, and for each one, anyone can participate to the project by :

     - sending a transaction to the pool using the ERC20 network. 
     
Each participant can follow the progress of the project and indeed choose to withdraw his part of the participation if the project used to be stopped or useless.
