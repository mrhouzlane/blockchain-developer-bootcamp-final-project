<strong> Description </strong> 


A smart contract helps to block the funds within blockchain until the project or startup founder makes progress in the project.

The project will develop a smart-contract driven crowdfunding platform built on Ethereum blockchain. 

The project will focus on two main events : 

- lending 
- borrowing 

I will use a special token created : TokenA to lend money 
I will use another token : TokenB to borrow money 

It will be decentrilized so everyone can participate. 

Everyone participating in the pool will win Token with the Compound base platform. 



<h1> Directory structure </h1> 

I will start by creating the croudfunding campaign first. 
With the use of blockchain trustless , the platform will keep track of the contributors. 


Anyone can contribute to a project with a <strong> minimum entry point : 0.05 ETH </strong> 

Projects allowed are github projects involving the blockchain only, so it should be something related to blockchain.

Members can verify all the transactions on Ethereum. 







<h1> Frontend project </h1> 

The project should keeping running and never go offline .

Will be built on : 

- Layer 2 Network 
- Compound 
- Aave (lending and borrowing platform) using data feed. 
- 

- Mutiple funders will be defined into structs with solidity .
